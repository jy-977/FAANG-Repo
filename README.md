# :bomb: FAANG!-Repo :bomb:


FAANG-Repo is a repository for NEW CHALLENGE of career. 
I aim to join to Mamang in next year (2023) as a Data Engineer. 
The practice of [leet code](https://leetcode.com/) problems is going to be uploaded irregularly for the coding interview. 
This is composed of 3 categories in general
